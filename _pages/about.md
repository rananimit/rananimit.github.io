I am a Lecturer in the Department of Mathematics at University of York.

My research focuses on classical and singular stochastic (geometric) partial differential equations, with applications in mathematical physics and fluid dynamics. I also work on enhancing asset pricing models by integrating stochastic analysis and machine learning, aiming to develop more realistic frameworks that align with empirical data and improve our understanding of their practical use in finance.
