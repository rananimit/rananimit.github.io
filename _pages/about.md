I am an Assistant Professor in Applied Mathematics at Imperial College London.

My research interests lie at the intersection between numerical analysis and deep learning. I primarily focus on the mathematical foundations of deep learning to discover mathematical models (partial differential equations) from data, and the development of novel and theoretically justified numerical techniques.

I am a member of the [Scientific Artificial Intelligence (SciAI) Center](https://sciaicenter.engineering.cornell.edu/) supported by the Office of Naval Research (ONR).
