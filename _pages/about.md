I am an Lecturer in the Department of Mathematics at University of York.

My research primarily focuses on the study of classical and singular stochastic (geometric) partial differential equations (SPDEs), a field deeply embedded within the realms of mathematical physics and fluid dynamics. Specifically, my main interest is to understand the local and global temporal behavior of solutions to these SPDEs, shedding light on their intricate dynamics. In addition to my core research, I am also passionate about extending the existing asset pricing models, using tools from stochastic analysis and machine learning, to create more robust and realistic frameworks that better align with empirical observations and offer a deeper understanding of how these models operate in practical financial scenarios.
